          Sometimes I think I can do a better job.  This page proves it.
          
          h2. Upper Merion Township Library
          
          My family love this library.  We hang out here several days each week.  I go to the web site constantly to search for books and check the hours.

          p(description). The current "site":http://www.umtownship.org/library is:
          
          * A mish mash of colors.
          * Contains lots of negative space.
          * Hides the catalog search behind a link.
          * Contains images of various sizes.

          p(description). My "redesign":http://umtl.heroku.com:
          
          * Simplifies the color palette, taking a cue from the township logo.
          * Spaces out elements evenly.
          * Places hours in the header.
          * Places news & events front and center.
          * Highlights the newsletter and facebook services.
          * Brings the catalog search to front page.
          
          h4. What About Mobile Users?

            I also thought about users on the go and optimized the site for mobile browsers.  The mobile version focuses on the most important information for users on the go:  the hours, the phone numbers, and searching the card catalog.
